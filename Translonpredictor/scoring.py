def sru_score(start, bigwig_df, rng, invert):
    '''
    Calculate the Start Rise Up (SRU) and  Step Down score based on counts in a specified range around a start position.

    Parameters:
    - start (int): Start position for which the SRU score is calculated.
    - bigwig_df (DataFrame): Pandas DataFrame containing transcript start positions and associated counts.
    - rng (int): Range parameter specifying the distance in nucleotides from the start position to consider.
    - invert (int): Flag indicating whether to invert the SRU score calculation:
      - 0: Calculate ln(numerator / denominator).
      - Non-zero: Calculate ln(denominator / numerator).

    Returns:
    - float: SRU score calculated based on the given parameters.

    This function calculates the SRU score using the formula:
    SRU = ln((1 + after_counts) / (1 + before_counts))
    or its inverse if `invert` is non-zero.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Generates a series of positions around `start` within the range `rng`.
    2. Filters these positions to match the correct reading frame based on `start % 3`.
    3. Splits these positions into those occurring before and after `start`.
    4. Filters `bigwig_df` based on these positions to get counts before and after `start`.
    5. Calculates the SRU score based on the counts, adjusting the calculation based on `invert`.

    Note: The natural logarithm (ln) is used for score calculation.

    Example:
    >>> start = 100
    >>> bigwig_df = pd.DataFrame({'tran_start': [95, 98, 101, 104], 'counts': [10, 15, 20, 25]})
    >>> sru_score(start, bigwig_df, 2, 0)
    0.28768207245178085

    In this example, `start` is 100, and the SRU score is calculated within a range of Â±2 nucleotides around 100.
    The function uses counts from positions before and after 100 to compute the SRU score.
    '''
    positions = pl.Series("positions", np.arange(start - rng, start + 3 + rng))
    # Filter positions to match the correct frame
    positions = positions.filter(positions % 3 == start % 3)
    # Split positions into before and after the start
    before_positions = positions.filter(positions < start)
    after_positions = positions.filter(positions > start)
    # Filter the bigwig_df based on these positions
    before_counts = bigwig_df.filter(pl.col("tran_start").is_in(before_positions))["counts"].sum()
    after_counts = bigwig_df.filter(pl.col("tran_start").is_in(after_positions))["counts"].sum()
    numerator = 1 + after_counts
    denominator = 1 + before_counts

    # Check for Start rise up or step down score
    sru = ln(numerator / denominator) if invert == 0 else ln(denominator / numerator)

    return float(sru)


def calculate_scores(start, stop, bigwig_df):
    '''
    Calculate various scores related to codon usage and frame preference within a specified range.

    Parameters:
    - start (int): Start position of the range for which scores are calculated.
    - stop (int): Stop position of the range for which scores are calculated.
    - bigwig_df (DataFrame): Pandas DataFrame containing transcript start positions and associated counts.

    Returns:
    - float: hrf - High Read Frame (HRF) score indicating frame preference.
    - float: avg - Average codon count per codon in the specified range.
    - float: nzc - Non-Zero Codon (NZC) ratio indicating the proportion of codons with non-zero counts.

    This function calculates the following scores based on the provided parameters:
    - hrf: Calculated as the ratio of counts in frame 0 to the maximum counts in frames 1 and 2, if frames 1 and 2 are not zero.
    - avg: Average number of codons per codon position in the specified range.
    - nzc: Ratio of codons with non-zero counts to the total number of codons in the specified range.

    The function first filters `bigwig_df` to include only rows where `tran_start` falls within the specified `start` and `stop`.
    It then calculates frame-specific counts and aggregates them to determine frame preferences (`hrf`).
    Codons primarily in frame 0 are counted to determine the proportion of all codons (`nzc`).

    Example:
    >>> start = 100
    >>> stop = 200
    >>> bigwig_df = pd.DataFrame({'tran_start': [95, 100, 105, 110, 115], 'counts': [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]})
    >>> calculate_scores(start, stop, bigwig_df)
    (0.5, 1.0, 0.6)

    In this example, `start` is 100 and `stop` is 200. The function calculates the HRF, AVG, and NZC scores based on
    counts from `bigwig_df` for positions between 100 and 200.
